Hello! My name is Yohannes and I am 21 years old and I currently live in Kalmar and am a student in Linnaeus university. I was born in in the capital of Sweden, Stockholm and lived there all of my life until the summer of August 2019 when I moved to here in Kalmar. My interest is in programming, working at the gym and socialize with friends and sometimes play videogames [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
