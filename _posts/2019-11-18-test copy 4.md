# What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?
Open Graph gives the developer the control of how the website is shared and seen in the most popular social medias. To check the meta-information of the said website all that you need to do is open in a chrome and click the extension's icon. There are 4 meta-tags that i used and those were title, type, url and image. Type of your object which in this case is a website, url is the permanent ID that will be used. Title is the what is simply said in the title. Image is what shows up when you share the title.
