# What do you think of static site generators?
Well static site generators like jekyll for example are very good for constructing and mainatining websites because they quite easy to work with the more you get used to it even though it is a lot to undertsands in the begining and can feel a bit too much. My favorite part would be that you can use markdown to write the content in a website that then is turned to HTML-code so that makes it alot easier hten using a regular HTML-design.

# What type of projects are they suitable for? 
They are mostly suitable for smaller and simplistic websites because in the events of real-time updates will most likely be delayed because the site must be rebuilt again before it can send out the new uppdate.
