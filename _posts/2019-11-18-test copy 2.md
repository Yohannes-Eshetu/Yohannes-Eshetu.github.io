# What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
A small text file that is in the root of the website and is what tells the search engines what "bots" short for "robots" are to do when visiting the website. I have made it so that robots are not allowed to visit my site  

# What is Humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site? 
Just like the robots.txt, humans.txt is in the root of the website but instead of providing for robots its for us humans about the said website. It should contain information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.
